            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.

                </li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.

                <li>Stir in the chocolate chips and chopped nuts (if using) until evenly distributed throughout the dough.

                <li>Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely.
