My 24th assignemnt! This is a simple html + css webpage showing some of the basic functionality in both of them. The main things this assignment needed was:

1. The ingredients in an unordered list and the directions in an ordered list.  
2. A picture of a cookie.  
3. The paragraph below the title.  
4. The link at the bottom to a Ghirardelli recipe.  
5. The suggestion to have the cookies with a glass of milk (I usually prefer hot chocoloate though).  

Almost none of the styling was not required by the assignment, but I had a good time designing it anyway.
